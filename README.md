# the_magick_hour
Application that computes the twelve hours of daytime and twelve hours of nighttime for occult operations.

### what is it?

In the practice of certain esoteric operations, the specific hours of the day are relevant but not set at the commonplace hour/minute increments (12:00, 1:00, 2:00, etc.). Practicing occultists divide the total number of daylight minutes by twelve, and the total number of nighttime minutes by twelve, to determine the length of the daylight and nighttime hours--typically greater than or less than the standard 60 minutes, depending on the time of the year. The computed hours are numbered 1 - 12 and have multiple additional significant qualities attached, but that much is outside the scope of this application.
